# This script was written to generate an svg for a drinks coaster with a bubble
# design. It randomly places bubbles of random sizes within the coaster circle.
# I noticed while observing bubbles in foam that there tend to be large bubbles
# and the gaps between them are filled with smaller bubbles so this script has
# the concept of small_bubbles and large_bubbles. These are generated according
# to the normal distribution and the parameters can be tweaked separately

[Coaster]

# radius of coaster in mm
radius = 96

# number of mm around edge to keep clear of bubbles

# normal distribution parameters of small bubbles in mm
small_bubble.mean = 1
small_bubble.deviation = 1
# fill colour and stroke (outline) colour of small bubbles
small_bubble.fill = none
small_bubble.stroke = blue

# normal distribution parameters of large bubbles in mm
large_bubble.mean = 36
large_bubble.deviation = 8
# fill colour and stroke (outline) colour of large bubbles
large_bubble.fill = none
large_bubble.stroke = black

# minimum size for a bubble in mm
