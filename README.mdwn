# Bubble Coaster

This script was written to generate an svg for a drinks coaster with a bubble
design. It randomly places bubbles of random sizes within the coaster circle.
I noticed while observing bubbles in foam that there tend to be large bubbles
and the gaps between them are filled with smaller bubbles so this script has
the concept of `small_bubbles` and `large_bubbles`. These are generated according
to the normal distribution and the parameters can be tweaked separately
