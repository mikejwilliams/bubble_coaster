# Bubble Coaster

This stand-alone script was written to generate an svg for a drinks coaster
with a bubble design. It randomly places bubbles of random sizes within the
coaster circle. I noticed while observing bubbles in foam that there tend to be
large bubbles and the gaps between them are filled with smaller bubbles so this
script has the concept of `small_bubbles` and `large_bubbles`. These are
generated according to the normal distribution and the parameters can be
tweaked separately.
