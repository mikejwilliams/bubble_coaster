# Bubble Coaster

This stand-alone script was written to generate an svg for a drinks coaster
with a bubble design. It randomly places bubbles of random sizes within the
coaster circle. I noticed while observing bubbles in foam that there tend to be
large bubbles and the gaps between them are filled with smaller bubbles so this
script has the concept of `small_bubbles` and `large_bubbles`. These are
generated according to the normal distribution and the parameters can be
tweaked separately.

## Usage

        usage: git [-h] [-c <config file path>] [<output file path>]

Output file defaults to `out.svg` and config file defaults to `default.cfg`.

### Example Usage

        python bubble_coaster.py
        python bubble_coaster.py my_out.svg
        python bubble_coaster.py -c my_config.cfg out.svg

I used `bubble_coaster.py` to generate svg files which were cut using a laser
CNC machine at [HacMAN](https://hacman.org.uk/) to produce a physical drinks
coasters.
